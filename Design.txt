Hiring Challenge Design Outline

Objective:
	Write a script or scripts to allow a user to add and delete users from a whitelist JSON file.

Technology:
	PHP 8.3 
	JSON

Approach:
	For ease of use and maintainance, I will create one script for adding users and one for deleting. 
	Since there will likely be some common functionality between the two, I will incorporate a helper 
	functions file for each to require. 

	In order to properly add a user I will need to fetch the ID from the Mojang API. 
	I will utilize PHP’s curl operations to accomplish this. 
	If the API responds with an ID, it will be added to the JSON file and the user will be informed 
	that the operation was successful. If an error is returned, the user will be alerted and the error 
	will be logged in an error log file. 

	Deleting users from the list will not require calling the Mojang API. 
	I will simply check for the existence of the supplied username or ID and remove if found.
